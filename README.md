# Inspirational Quote Page

This project was created as a solo project for Module 2 of the Scrimba Frontend Developer bootcamp. It is a simple web page that displays inspirational quotes along with their authors. Each time the page is refreshed, a random quote and background image are displayed. The quote box is clickable, allowing users to visit a specified URL (in this case, the Scrimba homepage!) in a new tab.
